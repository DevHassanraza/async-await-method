# Async & Await, Promises, and Callback Project in JavaScript

This project demonstrates the usage of asynchronous programming in JavaScript using:

- ✅ Callbacks  
- ✅ Promises  
- ✅ Async/Await  
- ✅ Error Handling in async code  
- ✅ Real-life examples (like API calls, timeouts, etc.)

---

## 📁 Project Structure



---

## 🚀 Features

- Understand the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** code
- Use of **callbacks** (basic and nested)
- Use of **Promises** and `.then()` chaining
- Use of `async` / `await` syntax
- Error handling with `try...catch`
- Simulated API calls using `setTimeout`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Callback Functions

```js
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data received!");
  }, 1000);
}

Would you like me to generate the `README.md` file as a downloadable file too?
